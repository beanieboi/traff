	* Updated the Makefile to include make option -Wall for better debuging.

	* ip_table.h Created definitions for ip_table_count_in_mag, cpia and ip_table_fetch_next.

	* Cleaned up calls in traff.c for ip_table_fetch_next and ip_table_destroy_table.

	* Removed or commented out unused variables in all files.

	* Added 'return 0;' to the end of the config_read_config_file function.

	* Added includes stdlib.h and errno.h to readconfig.h to remove compilation error with
	  external referances.

	* Corrected pthread_t definition and corrected pthread calls in traff.c -- Bug 585102 Seg Fault

	* Updated the calls for mysql from mysql_connect to mysql_real_connect

	* changed multiple instiances of %d to %ld when using timetags in snprintf and syslog calls

	* Very big changes in this one. First of all, module Data and all external dump-programms
	  are history. All necessary datafunctions where copy-n-pasted to traff.c. The different
	  dump-procedures where intergrated into traff.c as well. Now there is a dump-function (data_mysql_dump,
	  data_stdout_dump etc.) for each functionality.
	  Therefore some changes in the configuration-file where necesary. Option sql does not exists any more.
	  Instead od
	    dump <filename>
	  you now have to write
	    dump [ stdout | syslog | textfile <filename> | binfile <filename> | [ { mysql | pgsql } \
	    host database table user password ]

	* Also in traff.c, I implemented a whoile new structure. Now we have a central queue. This queue is
	  filled by small functions that a executed by pthread_create and only catches the packet from
	  the network. This queue is protected by 2 semaphores and 1 mutex. The mutex protects the queue so
	  only one can write or read at a time. The 2 semaphores are used to advoid busy-waiting.

	* I dropped the timer-function, for now. Again, time(0) is executed after aech processed package.

	* ip_table.c: I created a structure t_table that ca hold more than just the pointer to the table. Now
	  there is a  int next as well. therefore it is no longer necessary to supply the last IP to
	  ip_table_get_netxt() function. Also this in function and in ip_table_destroy_table I changed the
	  recursion to 4 nested for-loops. This took me some problems I had with starting at the point I
	  last stopped. Also, this code is easier to understand.

	* The length of a packet is now calculated using pcap's pcap_pkthdr->len (length off-wire).

	* traff.c (start_accounting): moved nice(-5) out of while loop. :)

	* traff.c (push_queue): Corrected semaphore handling for the case that a packet is not pushed.
	 (pop_queue): Accounting is stopped for the case, that sem_wait is passed without a packet in the queue for popping.

	* Introduced new threading scheme.

	* Changed from multiple functions *_cipa to one cipa in data.c.

Traff 0.5

	* Added alpha version of postgreSQL dumping module

	* Traff now forks for each device once.

	* Data is first stored into a buffer. Periodically this
 		buffer is transcripted to the table and again periodically
  	dumped to the database.

	* First trys to pass PPID to mysql_traff_dump, so when a error occours,
  	mysql_traff_dump can kill its parrent.
