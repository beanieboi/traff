INSTALLATION / PRECONDITIONS
  
  The script is being developed under Debian running kernel 2.6.x, but it should run on different 
  kernel versions and different distributions. You must pay attention if you compile your kernel. 
  keep in mind that the option CONFIG_PACKET must be compiled in. Generally, if tcpdump works, Traff
  should work as well.
  What you will need is pcap- and optionally Mysql- and PgSQL- libraries and header files to compile Traff.
  If all preconditions are met you can begin by

    1. Unpacking the sources 
    2. Run ./configure -- you may want to run ./configure --help to enable options: --enable-mysql --enable-postgresql
    5. Type make install
       Make install will copy binary files to /usr/local/bin. If you don like this, edit
       the Makefile or install manually.
    6. Change the configuration-file /etc/traff.conf to suit to your needs
    7. Start traff.

    8. -Optionally- 
       There is a initd-script for traff called traff.initd. This script was intended to run
       on Debian systems. You my need to change it if you use another distribution. With this script 
       you can configure you system to start traff at boot-time. Please remember to start traff only 
       _after_ you set up your network.
