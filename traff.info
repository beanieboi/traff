Introduction
************

   Welcome to Taff, the traffic accounting program. Traff is a program to 
monitor you network and account traffic by ip. You can configure Traff in 
different ways to best suit your needs. One big advantage is that you can 
specify primary IPs, which means, that only the information about that IPs 
will be computed.
   Traff uses threads to output data, so while your are dumping your information 
over a slow network no package should be missed. Also it uses FIFOs to communicate 
with the dumping program making it easy to create a own dumping-program that fits 
your needs.
   Traff is being developed by Hans Marcus Krüger (hanskruger@iname.com) at the 
University on Dresden, Germany. The original files can be downloaded at 
Sourceforge.net. It is released under GPL and help is welcome.

Configuration File
******************

   The configuration file /etc/traff.conf holds all information Traff needs to know 
to be able to run. Here we will give a short description on its syntax. It can be 
divided into two sections: global options and categories.

Global Options:
---------------

  Device <device> [<device> [<device> [...]]]
  	Takes a space-separated list of devices Traff should listen on.
   	Example:
	     
	     Device eth0 eth1

  Period <integer> 
  	Takes the number of seconds Traff waits between two dumps
        Example:

	Period 600   # This will make Traff dump every 10 minute

Categories:
-----------

  Traff can be configured to account in different manners for the same traffic. Each 
manner represents a category. each category starts with the keyword Cat followed by a 
string, which my only contain [1-0,a-z,A-Z,_]. This string will be the name of the 
category and should be unique for this configuration file. A category-statement stops
with the beginning of the next or the end of file. Inside a category the following 
options may be specified:

  primary {account|ignore} IP MASK PORT
  	In primary you can specify the first part of the rules. A IP must match one of
	the primary rules successfully to be accounted (and it must match a secondary also).
	You can specify as many primary rules as you want. the will be tested sequentially
	as you inserted them into the configuration file. The first rule that matches will
	cause Traff to evaluate the tag. If it is set to account, Traff will account the 
	package, otherwise drop it if the tag is set to ignore.
	As you can see, the order matters.
	
	IP should be a ip of the format X.X.X.X where X are integers between 0..255.
	MASK follows the same format above.
	PORT is a integer between 0..65535 and specify the port of the ip that is being 
	checked. If it is set to zero any port will match.

  	If a Package successfully matched a primary rule, it will be checked against secondary 
	rules to see if it should be accounted or not, depending, again, on the tag set.
	Only if the package matches a primary AND a secondary rule it will be accounted on 
	that category.

	Traff has two standard rules that are appended on every chain (primary and secondary), 
	which will return ignore. So, if you don't specify at least one primary and one secondary
	rule Traff will never account anything.
	
	Example:

	  primary ignore  192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 0  # Rule 1
	  primary account 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0      # Rule 2
	  secondary account 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 80	       # Rule 3
	
	The above example will account all http-traffic from 192.168.0.0 (Rule 2 and 3), except for
	Hosts in subnet 192.168.2.0.
	
  secondary {account|ignore} IP MASK PORT
	See explanations on primary rules above
  
  sql HOST DATABASE TABLE USER PASSWORD
        This entry is used by a dumping-program, to connect to a sql-server. every table is 
	required to the following fields:
	    Name     Type      Description
	    input    INTEGER   Takes the value of data received by that ip
	    output   INTEGER   Takes the value of data sent by that ip
	    ip	     CHAR(15)  Takes the ip
	    timetag  INTEGER   Takes the integer part of th number of seconds 
	    		       since epoch divided by time diver

	The dumping program is clever enough to determine if a update or a insert if to 
	be executed (by trying to update first and if this fails it inserts). So you can set
	your timedivider to 86400, and period to 600 and you will update you DB every 10 minutes,
	and keep track of daily usage of each ip.
  
  timedivider INT
        Takes an INTEGER NOT ZERO. This is used to generate the timetag in the SQL-dump. Please see
	SQL entry for more information
  
  bytedivider
  	If this is specified, dumping programs will divide all traffic-data with that number. 
	This is interesting f you prefer to store your data in you database in kilobytes o megabytes.
	this can be used to avoid overflows in you database. The division is only done at dump-time,
	so you must take care to let Traff dump its data before an internal overflow can happen.
	Example:

		bytedivider 1024 # this will store the amount in kilobytes	    
	
 dump EXEC
 	This takes an executable that will be executed at a dump. So care is to be taken here to avoid
	any exploits. The program is executed with the following arguments:
		FIFO Filename - The filename where data will be dumped into
		Category      -	The name of the category
		Conf File     - Configuration File used by Traff
		PPID	      - The Parents PID
	Probably you will want to use some ready programs for this like traff_stdout_dump or 
	traff_mysql_dump.
