	Traff - Traffic Accounting Program
	Version 0.7

WHAT IS IT? 

  Traff is a program that attaches itself to one or more network interfaces, 
  sniffs all IP-packages passing at it and accounts each packets size. The collected 
  information can be dumped to a mysql-Database, for further processing.


HOW DOES IT WORK?

  The whole thing about Traff, is that you can specify for what IP you want to account 
  the traffic, and even for what IPs talking with which peer. This means, that if you 
  have a big up-link and you want to discover how much each or some hosts on your network 
  are using this up-link, you can do that without caring about the other IP, as other 
  programs do. So much less data will be stored at your database.
  The program runs as a daemon and periodically will dump all information collected to the 
  database, syslog or a file.

INSTALLATION / PRECONDITIONS
  
  The script is being developed under Debian running kernel 2.6.x, but it should run on different 
  kernel versions and different distributions. You must pay attention if you compile your kernel. 
  keep in mind that the option CONFIG_PACKET must be compiled in. Generally, if tcpdump works, Traff
  should work as well.
  What you will need is pcap- and optionally Mysql- and PgSQL- libraries and header files to compile Traff.
  If all preconditions are met you can begin by

    1. Unpacking the sources 
    2. Run ./configure -- you may want to run ./configure --help to enable options: --enable-mysql --enable-postgresql
    5. Type make install
       Make install will copy binary files to /usr/local/bin. If you don like this, edit
       the Makefile or install manually.
    6. Change the configuration-file /etc/traff.conf to suit to your needs
    7. Start traff.

    8. -Optionally- 
       There is a initd-script for traff called traff.initd. This script was intended to run
       on Debian systems. You my need to change it if you use another distribution. With this script 
       you can configure you system to start traff at boot-time. Please remember to start traff only 
       _after_ you set up your network.
