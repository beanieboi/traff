	Traff - Traffic Accounting Programm
	Version 0.3
	(c) 2001 - Hans Marcus Krüger
	

WHAT IS IT? 

  Traff is a programm that attaches itself to ine or more network interfaces, 
  sniffs all IP-packeges passing at it and accounts each packets size. The collected 
  information can be dumped to a mysql-Database, for further processing.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
  The whole thing about traff, is that you can specify for what ip you want to account 
  the traffic, and even for what ips talking with witch peer. This means, that if you 
  have a big uplink and you want to discover how much each or some hosts on your network 
  are using this uplink, you can do that without caring about the other ip, as other 
  programs do. So much less data will be stored at your database.
  The prgramm runs as a deamon and periodicaly will dump all information collected to the 
  database. In futere more databeses will be availibel, and writing the code for our own
  needs ist not difficult at all, as the dump is done using a FIFO and a programm that is 
  specified in the configutration file.
  
  An Example:
  Currently this programm is beeing developed for a big student network (AG-DSN) connected 
  to the university TU-Dresden over a 100MBit FX-cable. We have 8 subnets (S0..S7) and would
  like to connect data for University-Intern traffic (UN-INT), but not Student-intern-traffic, and 
  University-extern traffic (UN-Ext).
  so we have to rules, the first accounting everythig for hots in S0..S7 and going to UN-INT, 
  and the second, accounting everytinh fo S0..S7 going tu UN-EXT. But out database will only hold 
  infoirmation about hosts in S0..S7, reducing a lot the size of our database, which can grow quiet
  big, if you consider that we have 1200 users. Every 5 minutes the data is dumped into a MySQL-Database. 
  our Data is collected on a dailybase. The conversion is done by the dumping-programm, 
  so that no aditional scripts are needed neither no further processing.
   
UPDATE
  
  Update-information can be found in file UPDATE

INSTALLATION / PRECONDITIONS
  
  The script is beeing developed under Debian running kernel 2.4.x, but it should run on diferent 
  kernel versions and different distributions. You must pay attention if you compile your kernel. 
  keep in mind that the option CONFIG_PACKET must be compiled in. Generaly, if tcpdump works, traff
  should work as well.
  What you will need is pcap- and Mysql- libaries and header files to compile traff.
  If all preconditions are met you can begin by

    1. unpacking the sources 
    2. changing to that directory and type make
    3. copy the file traff.conf to /etc and modify it to satisfy your needs
    4. copy all executables to /usr/local/sbin
    5. copy traff.initd to /etc/init.d/traff or the equivalent directory on your system
    6. set up your mysql-database
    7. start the programm with /etc/init.d/traff start
  
  As Time goes by I will automate intallation an add more detailed inforamtion here.
