	Traff - Traffic Accounting Program
	Version 0.7

WHAT IS IT?

  Traff is a program that attaches itself to one or more network interfaces,
  sniffs all IP-packages passing at it and accounts each packets size. The collected
  information can be dumped to a MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL database, syslog, or
  a file for further processing.


HOW DOES IT WORK?

  The whole thing about Traff, is that you can specify for what IP you want to account
  the traffic, and even for what IPs talking with which peer. This means, that if you
  have a big up-link and you want to discover how much each or some hosts on your network
  are using this up-link, you can do that without caring about the other IP, as other
  programs do. So much less data will be stored at your database.
  The program runs as a daemon and periodically will dump all information collected to the
  database, syslog or a file.


INSTALLATION / PRECONDITIONS

  You will need pcap libraries and header files to compile Traff. MySQL/MariaDB
  and PostgreSQL libraries are optional.
  Generally, if tcpdump works, Traff should work as well.

    1. Unpacking the sources
    2. Run: zig build
       Optional features can be enabled with:
         zig build -Dmysql=true      -- Enable MySQL/MariaDB support
         zig build -Dpsql=true       -- Enable PostgreSQL support
       By default, MariaDB's pkg-config name (libmariadb) is used. If you
       have MySQL instead of MariaDB, pass:
         zig build -Dmysql=true -Dmysql-pkg=mysqlclient
       On macOS with Homebrew, libraries may not be in the default search
       path. Pass the library directory explicitly:
         zig build -Dpsql=true -Dpsql-libdir=/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/lib
    3. The binary will be at zig-out/bin/traff. Copy it where you like.
    4. Change the configuration-file /etc/traff.conf to suit to your needs
    5. Start traff.

    6. -Optionally-
       There is a initd-script for traff called traff.initd. This script was intended to run
       on Debian systems. You may need to change it if you use another distribution. With this
       script you can configure your system to start traff at boot-time. Please remember to
       start traff only _after_ you set up your network.

  Docker:
    A Dockerfile is provided to build traff on Alpine Linux with all optional
    features enabled:
      docker build -t traff .
